# Welcome to the Airline Management Application 🚀

This is a full-stack application developed by **Lisa**, **Kyle**, and **Steve** for the SDAT Final Sprint Project. The app helps manage airline-related data such as airports, flights, passengers, and more, providing an easy-to-use interface and robust backend system.

## 📖 What’s Inside?

This app has two parts:

1. **Frontend**: A beautiful user interface to interact with the airline data, built with React.
2. **Backend**: A powerful REST API built using Java Spring Boot for managing data efficiently.
